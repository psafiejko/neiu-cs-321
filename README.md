### Application Name: 
SJ Carpentry

### Project Topic/Objective: 

My project will be an application for creating construction estimates. It will take down various information from the user which will later be used to create the estimate and as contact information. I plan on including images of previous jobs as a sample of the quality of work being provided. The application will include information on the types of jobs the contractor can complete and sample pricing. The goal is to make it as easy as possible to keep track of new clients and their information. 

### Motivation:

The motivation behind my project is my father. For so long now, he has had to manually keep track of all his clients and their information. He sometimes gets things mixed up and can't seem to find a proper way of organizing himself. To save him time and patience, I wanted to create this application so he will have a way to keep his clients organized and be able to tend to new clients at a faster rate. I've always wanted to help my father with this issue, but I could never figure out a proper solution. Through this class I will be able to create said application and make his life a little bit easier.

### Server Side Components:

As far as Server Side Components go for this project, I will be storing various information about the user. This information will later be used in the estimate. Data that will be included: Name, Address, Phone Number, Email Address, Type of Job, Urgency, Additional Information.
